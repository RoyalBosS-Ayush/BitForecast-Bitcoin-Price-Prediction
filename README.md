# BitForecast - Bitcoin Price Prediction

BitForecast is an open-source project that focuses on predicting the price of Bitcoin using a Python notebook. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides you through the process of analyzing historical Bitcoin data, preprocessing it, training a predictive model, and making price predictions. It also includes a sample CSV file with historical Bitcoin price data for your convenience.

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter notebook for Bitcoin price prediction
- Demonstrates step-by-step data analysis and model training process
- Provides a sample CSV file with historical Bitcoin price data
- Easy experimentation and customization

## Installation

To use BitForecast, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoyalBosS-Ayush/BitForecast-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd BitForecast-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
```

3. Launch Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file and follow the instructions within the notebook to perform Bitcoin price prediction.

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb` provides a comprehensive guide to predicting Bitcoin prices. Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to:

- Load and analyze historical Bitcoin price data
- Preprocess the data for model training
- Train a predictive model using machine learning techniques
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Make price predictions for future time periods

The sample CSV file `BitcoinPrice.csv` contains historical Bitcoin price data and is already integrated into the notebook for convenience.
